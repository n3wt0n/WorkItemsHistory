# WorkItems History
A Visual Studio Team Services extension to show the work items history.

##What
This extension adds a "History" hub to the Work section of VSTS which allows you to see the history of the added/modified work items.

##Why
Working in a team is not always easy, especially when you need to have "things under control". With this extension, you can have a little more control of what is happening on your work.

##Prerequisites
A Visual Studio Team Services project and some work items.

##Usage
Install the Extension in your account. Go to the "Work" section and click the "History" hub (in the top navigation bar, near "Backlog" and "Queries").
