2. Click on the `History` hub title onthe upper navigation bar (next to "Backlogs" and "Queries").
3. A number of edited work items will be shown, with their relevant information.
4. Click on the "Load more Work Items" button to have more work items listed.
5. Click on the work item title to open it's informational pop-up.
